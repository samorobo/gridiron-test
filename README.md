## CORS Configuration
During development, the API is configured to allow all routes access using the following setting:
```
CORS(app, origins=["*"], methods=["GET"], allow_headers=["Content-Type"])
```
This configuration permits any origin to access your API's GET endpoints, which is useful for testing across various environments and during development.

## Important note for production
When moving to production, i highly recommended to restrict access to your API. For example, you can update the configuration to only allow requests from your trusted frontend URL. An updated configuration might look like this:
```
CORS(app, origins=["https://your-frontend.vercel.app"], methods=["GET"], allow_headers=["Content-Type"])
```
By limiting access to your specific frontend, you improve the security of your API and prevent unauthorized requests from other domains.
